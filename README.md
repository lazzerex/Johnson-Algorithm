By using this algorithm, we can find the shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a given weighted directed Graph in which weights may be negative. Johnson’s algorithm uses both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford as subroutines. If we apply Dijkstra’s Single Source shortest path algorithm for every vertex, considering every vertex as the source, we can find all pair shortest paths in O(V*VLogV) time.
